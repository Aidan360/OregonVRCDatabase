    <h2> Basic Bot Description</h2>
    <body>
        3249U's bot is a Flywheel Turret bot. It has a X-drive Chassis with 3.25 inch Omni Wheels. It has 3 odometry wheels with 2 on the sides and one at the back. It uses a flexwheel to double conveyer intake which leads to a verticle pneumatic Indexer. The Indexer pushes a disc into the 90 degree flywheel. The turret mechanism can change its angle due to it being mounted onto a polycarbonate gear. The intake and roller mechanism are PTO'd together to prevent motor overheating by powering both at once. It has two expansion systems. 7 Shooters for centerfield and a low linear slider. It is coded within PROS with an Autonmous Aiming System.
