		<h2> Chassis </h2>
        <p> The chassis consists of 6 wheels and 4 motors. The 4 motors are located on the middle and back wheels with the front wheels moving due to the geartrain. 
			The Geartrain makes sure the motors are all sharing their power at all times and help keep traction when moving and while pushing. 
			One special thing about the chassis are the locked omnis located in the middle of both sides of the chassis. Locked Omnis are created by ziptying each indivdual small wheel to prevent them from turning which allows for more traction. Locked omnis have more traction than using the traditional friction wheel. </p>
