        5686Z's bot is a linear slingshot at a 10 degree angle. The slingshot design prevents jamming and is designed to stuff from the low goal. It has a direct 600 rpm drive an 2.75in. omni wheels. A 600 rpm motor powers the intake through direct drive and the roller mech at a 1:5 ratio. The intake has two rows of flex wheels, 3in. at the bottom, and the roller mech is two 4in. omni wheels. The robot has a single cylinder string mech on each side, each firing three strings. The robot also has a deployable wall for endgame to protect rollers, which is released by one pneumatic cylinder and is extended passively through rubber bands. The robot uses V5 and PID looping in autonomous.
